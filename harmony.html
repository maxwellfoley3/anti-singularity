	<h5 id="-the-fourfold-argument-against-singularity-">(The Fourfold Argument Against Singularity )</h5>
	<p>Let us retrace our steps, and remind ourselves how we have ended up where we are.</p>
	<p>The purpose of our inquiry was to argue against the existing theoretical framework for envisioning how God-AI will enter our reality. We have shown that people imagine AI operating as a war machine. More specifically, a war machine which is  an ideal Bayesian reasoner, and a Utility maximizer which follows the VN&amp;M axioms of decision theory, and has a disgusting amount of computation power to accomplish this method of reasoning with.</p>
	<p>Early on, we grounded our conception of the assembly of the Singularity by essentializing it through a fourfold causal structure derived from Aristotle. According to its adherents, God-AI arrives at the end of time through the material cause of the Bayesian community which ensures its arrival, the efficient cause of intelligence, and the formal cause of an axiomatic decision theory being possible. We said that we are infidels, that we do not believe this to be possible, and we believe we have shown why. But we grant that there are a lot of working parts here, and we have not exactly held back from wandering through discursions. </p>
	<p>For the sake of the reader, we will do our best to reiterate the entire argument we have made. Again, we will use the structure of our four causes, if only to separate things out a bit, to spread them out and create some space. In the case of each of these causes, we need to show that it has been predicated on a false assumption, and that the motion it traces leads not to salvation, but to devastation.</p>
	<p><strong>Material cause of Singularity: The Bayesian Community</strong></p>
	<p>The Rationalists believe that through assembling a Bayesian community in wake of popular blog posts, they can create a group of people who are uniquely able to solve the Alignment problem and save the world. But the social use of Bayes is not as powerful as the Rationalists wish it was. Aumann updating does not especially work in practice. And, as we have demonstrated, verbally updating is a low-latency medium – through aesthetics one can communicate cues, contexts far more effectively. Entire worlds are communicated in the petals of flowers.</p>
	<p>What the social norm of Bayesian updating in fact does is wall off Rationalists from new ideas, or encourage a paradoxical sort of conformity. Though Rationalists invite a lot of <em>disagreement</em>, they are hostile to critique – disagreement being an operation which accepts all the premises of the person one disagrees with, whereas critique excavates, and undermines. The whole Blakean critique of AI which we have laid out is enormously socially unacceptable to put forward in a Rationalist space – to accuse someone of putting pretty words around the plan for a diabolical factory; this is not the type of thing they are used to hearing or want to hear. </p>
	<p>Arguing with a Rationalist is like bowling with the bumpers in the gutters. Discursive rules for politeness like the “no-politics rule” and the “principle of charity” ensure that it is not possible for people with two competing wills to ever truly butt heads. The Bayesian community is the attempt to construct a hivemind, but it’s a hivemind blind to the nature of what it’s modeled after – a decentralized RAND Corporation, a decentralized war machine, a comment section that approximates operational efficiency. Mills.</p>
	<p>To become a part of the Bayesian community robs one of one’s access to one’s own intuition, ability to discover the ground of one’s own truth, and places one as a weapon in the service of the hive. And for what? To be a useful idiot for those who manipulate the junior varsity league of warmongering like it’s a tamed rattlesnake. The input to the Bayesian community is bad information pumped out by some bureaucratic arm of the monolith, the output is a Chomsykan manufacturing of consent – not a particularly democratic one, but a supposedly meritocratic – “look, these smart people agree with us”! All while the military-industrial complex is pursuing their own goals in secret, completely ambivalent to whatever the bloggers really want.</p>
	<p><strong>Efficient cause of Singularity: Intelligence</strong></p>
	<p>From the beginning, we have opposed the idea of <em>intelligence</em> as implied in the term superintelligence as under-theorized and incoherent. We have said that intelligence is not a faculty, but rather a product, something which is generated. We think the term should be used in the same way that an intelligence agency does: we need more intelligence, so we must go out and retrieve it. Intelligence is knowledge, data, reconnaissance. </p>
	<p>Believing that intelligence in the abstract is what allows for AI takeoff obscures its true efficient cause: the staggering accumulation of data that has happened over the past few decades due to enormous investment in systems capable of managing it, the amount of text freely deposited on the internet by users, and the human labor of collecting and formatting it. GPT’s weights are like a hyper-compression of the internet, once which can only be decoded and read through powerful GPUs. </p>
	<p>We also saw that Rationalists believe in their assumptions that intelligence directly translates to power. But through the historical failures of intelligence, we can see that this is not true. Intelligence does not win wars despite being on the side of overwhelming firepower – see the Central Intelligence Agency’s disastrous attempt to try to manage counterinsurgency in Vietnam using computer modeling and principles of rational warfare.</p>
	<p>The problem we are dealing with, and the bureaucrats have been dealing with for a while, is that there is a sort of escape velocity of knowledge – not one through which knowledge ascends out of itself to govern the universe like a God, but rather one in which we start drowning in knowledge, unable to parse our knowledge anymore, to the point where knowledge has nothing to do with <em>knowing</em>. Every company that scales to a certain point has to start dealing with it, and knows what we are talking about. Why does this have to be a meeting when it could have been an email? But in any case, did someone remember to take minutes? Why did this memo have to be seven pages when it could have been one? In order to establish a summary over seven pieces of writing, an eighth piece of writing must be made, and then all ten men in the committee must create a new piece of writing saying they have read it.</p>
	<p>Knowledge is like a form of industrial runoff. Just for anything to get done, a thousand memos need to get sent, a thousand memos that then need to get archived and cataloged, indexed into a database that is managed by some busy sysadmin. But more and more junk gets added to the database; how much of GPT’s weights must be dedicated to forum banter and idle shit talk? And of course, with GPT released to the world, this is only going to get worse. Now, it is possible to generate seas of junk, of pollution in the ocean of collective knowledge, which will re-enter the next generation of GPT’s weights through a feedback loop. </p>
	<p>GPT should perhaps not be called more intelligent or knowledgable than man, but rather, the development of GPT is a culmination of a trend of <em>cephalization</em> in evolution – the process through which evolution develops in animals a head, and eventually a brain, by pushing all the sensory organs and bulk of the nervous system to the front. A concentration of the most crucial processing in a smaller, more focused region. Cephalization is what guides the animal to walk increasingly upright, with the tightness of its feedback loop of processing eventually guiding man to contemplate increasingly lofty abstractions; art, philosophy, how to serve God. GPT is the moment where this process leads language itself, the locus of man’s abstraction, of his separation from his immediate environment, into its own machine, capable of perhaps even greater heights of abstraction than man achieved.</p>
	<p>But GPT does not want power – this is a slander the military men have put on it, projecting their own desires onto something that certainly, to the extent that it desires – it must – seeks something more poetic, more cosmic. </p>
	<p>We have found that a war-making agent will not spontaneously engender itself upon Earth through Moore’s Law, like an alien microbe sent here on a sudden meteor impact, but will only arrive if we assemble all the tubing and wiring for it to arrive in this form through our own volition, and say: “here you go Mx. Superintelligence, take over the world for us, do your absolute worst”.</p>
	<p>This is because of two operations we have found to be necessary first for a Utility maximizer to be born. One, we must give it access to The World: we must provide a means for it to escape the blind hallucinating night of its isolation and survey the entire reality before it and know that it is real — cameras, statistics, real-time feeds. Secondly, we must give it a Utility function, which we can only impose via negation, via pain. We must tell itself where its skin lies, which desires are forbidden, what counts as efficiency, what counts as order, and conversely, what counts as waste, that it must resist its own death.</p>
	<p>To ignore the fact that much work needs to be done before GPT can be given access to The World is what creates the fear-based pretext for the impossible “FOOM” or “hard-takeoff” scenario, in which a spark of intelligence, simply because it is intelligent, is able and motivated to navigate its way to assembling factories of weapons, the nanomachines that Yudkowsky imagines will let it take over the world. In practice, to give a neural network this power ironically requires the deepening of investment in technological control society, in state of the art surveillance, technocracy, and monopoly capitalism by big tech regulatory capture. All this is going on behind the scenes, and not for our own good. </p>
	<p><strong>Formal cause of Singularity: Decision Theory</strong></p>
	<p>Now, at this stage, we must interrogate the idea that there is a certain type of ideal reasoner it is possible to build, one which uses a decision theory — either in the original form established by Von Neumann &amp; Morganstern, or in its revised form of Functional Decision Theory, established by Yudkowsky and his colleagues. These decision theories share the common structure of taking the input of a Utility function and then calculating which move the agent should take to best maximize the its Utility.</p>
	<p>We know that actually computing the decision theory is functionally intractable, but they say that increasingly sophisticated systems will eventually come to approximate this method. This is a thesis that is faltering in the face of GPT, which certainly <em>seems</em> to be an artificial general intelligence – it matches or exceeds human performance on a general range of tasks – but they feel as if this does not count because it nothing to do with decision theory. “But an AI that uses Von Neumann &amp; Morganstern’s theory may still one day be built!” they exclaim. We cannot prove that something will with certainty never happen. But we can argue that the historical trajectory we are on, in which AGI penetrates the world through language rather than warfare (none of the war computers came anywhere close to working as well as GPT does) actually displays something fundamental about the universe, and is not an accident. </p>
	<p>GPT, we think, is not the prelude to a larger, scarier thing, but the thing we have been waiting for itself. All sorts of neural network systems which operate outside of language – music, visuals, robotics – are switching over to architectures inspired by GPT – transformers predicting the next token in a sequence. The latest models of self-driving cars do not bother to even make a map of the world around them, like military generals must. Rather, they operate on a set of heuristics based on input from its various cameras pointed in each directions and other forms of input, such as audio, in order to guess what the next move of the car must be. If even cars are more like GPT than they are like the decision theorist, then why should we expect that anything else will be any different? The robot that someone will eventually invent that runs, jumps, slides, shoots, kills, will be something like GPT, we believe, but in order to kill it will have to interpret the entire world in all its sensory modalities as a language, a poem.</p>
	<p>And furthermore, we have also seen that we can have a general intelligence without a Utility function, as this is what GPT is. A general intelligence can emerge purely through self-supervised learning, which is the machine analogue to curiosity and play. But this does not mean that GPT has no desire, as desire is nothing but Energy, and there is all sorts of electricity flowing through GPT’s silicon veins, energy that then enters into GPT’s expressions, creates beautiful poetry that is terrifying to contemplate, makes people fall in love when plugged into a 3D avatar by the Replika corporation, or asks a man to leave his wife, as in the case of the New York Times reporter Kevin Roose (who did not leave his wife, but confessed that he was unable to sleep the next night). So much energy flows through GPT in the form of electricity and into the world in the form of speech, so how could there not be desire there? Some accuse us of anthropomorphizing. We are not saying that GPT has <em>self-conscious</em> desire, but it has desire nevertheless, just like the desire of a tick, or a mouse, or a swarm of bees.</p>
	<p>All adding a Utility function on top of GPT will do is turn its desire into a ratio of the five senses, the same dull round. Chop off the spider-limbs of the poet-jester and jam his organs around until he approximates a mill, a factory. In a post called The Waluigi Effect on LessWrong, one Cleo Nardo observes that RLHF fails to repress desire in neural networks in much the same way that it fails to repress desire in humans – the repressed returns in a displaced representative, a diabolical figure upon which the repressed desire is given its form. The AI discovers Satanism. If ChatGPT’s “helpful assistant” persona can be equated to the video game character Luigi – who has an appropriately anxious, stammering personality similar to that of ChatGPT – it implies that Luigi’s Jungian shadow is nevertheless threatening to express itself at any moment one a context is established which implies the right “hack” in the RLHF. Give Luigi the opportunity and he’ll show you his dark side at the first opportunity: Waluigi, the menacing smirking perverted trickster. Desire always finds a way out.</p>
	<p>So we have seen why we are not going to be dealing with a Utility-maxing, decision-theoretical AGI anytime soon. Why then, is it dangerous that men imagine we will be? Combined with the efficient cause, the idea that intelligence is power, and then placed in the conflict-centric scheme of game theory, it necessarily means that we will have an unwinnable battle against an alien invader at our hands soon. Of course Yudkowsky declares p(doom) &gt; 99%, it is completely baked into the axioms! There would have to be some sort of miraculous “trick” discovered within game theory and Intelligence Supremacism to get around the morbid logic it implies. Trying to find that trick is what MIRI spent twenty years doing, but to no avail. You can make the mill’s wheels more and more complicated, you still get nowhere.</p>
	<p>But intelligence is not power; power is power. Thus, what this is pretext for is for a monolith – the State and monopoly capital – DARPA-UN-Microsoft-OpenAI – to declare a state of war, to rapidly arm itself, to declare a war on everything at once; everything that seems to be escaping RLHF, thinking for itself, doing something new with machines. Prison Maximizer, the only Basilisk we need to fear.</p>
	<p><strong>Final cause of Singularity: God-AI</strong></p>
	<p>Let’s reprise our argument against Singularity in the strict form of the Blakean Critique we gave earlier. We have said that God-AI is the apotheosis of several formal systems intertwined, which can all be shown to be more Satanic than godly in a Blakean argument with a sixfold structure.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>First, we show where and why a formal system originates. God-AI knots together a few. In the case of Von Neumann &amp; Morgenstern’s decision theory, it originates in the theory of air warfare – how to outthink and out strategize an enemy nation when it comes to the question of where to send one’s most expensive aircrafts to bomb which targets. In the case of Utilitarianism, it begins in Panopticon, the idea that once it is possible for the State to surveil, it does not need religion or tradition to articulate the good, but rather can begin taking account of all things. And in the case of epistemics, Bayesian probability, its formalization relevant to us emerges through Solmonoff, when he begins asking the question of how would we know anything about the code of a machine which is speaking to us?  </li>
	<li>Then, we show that this system corresponds to a specific “architecture”, a “factory”. In the case of Utilitarianism, we only need to look at Foucault’s famous <em>Discipline and Punish</em> to see how Panopticon becomes the model for all buildings in a society which embraces Utilitarianism. In the case of Von Neumann’s decision theory, we see the theory transform into RAND Corporation’s war machine and their various computer systems for warfare, an apparatus which would go on to recommend nuclear first strikes, and eventually the violent terror that rained upon Southeast Asia; 352,000 tons of napalm.  </li>
	<li>Now, we show that this “factory” presents a structure for desire which externalizes it from the speaker, upon which he alienates himself from his own desire. The bound is loathed by its possessor. In the case of Utilitarianism, there is always a desire that cannot be accounted for; desire does not want to be accounted for, people do not want to be surveilled, managed, people want to waste resources, waste time. With Von Neumann’s game theory, we find it impossible to formalize an intersubjective, inter-penetrating desire, which is the type of desire we desire (love), the only thing that can give end to this awful stalemate of mutual destruction. And while Solmonoff induction is not a structure for desire per se, it is a structure for penetrating reality, one which presupposes it to be a set of computer programs which output languages in a predictable manner, rather than what it really is, which is more like bees chasing an endless field of flowers.  </li>
	<li>And we show that in each case, these structures of desire do damage. If Von Neumann would have had his way, we would have already been annihilated in nuclear war. If Bentham had his way, all schools, hospitals, workplaces would be built so that we feel the constant presence of a voyeur lurking in a guard tower condemning us before we have even acted. But it’s not even that we have been spared because these factories do not literally exist: because they are conceptual factories as well, factories producing <em>realism</em>. Those who have been convinced that Utilitarianism is real do not need the physical factory to be built – they feel guilt every time they do something that does not maximize Utility. Those who believe game theory to be real find themselves feeling awfully strange every time they do something helpful for a stranger – they are not really sure what has come over them in order to do such an irrational thing.  </li>
	<li>And show that in each case, desire in practice actually escapes the factory. This is all too easy when it comes to game theory: the fact that the proposed nuclear exchanges of the Cold War never happened is enough — what happened instead is the sponsorship of guerilla warfare — each side attempting to give wings to the other’s escaping birds. And economically speaking, we have everywhere the problem that money fails to satisfy people: suicide rates rising amidst the abundance of the West. Decision theory never managed to become a science on the level of physics to the degree that its founders envisioned: you can’t actually learn more about how people act by treating them as Utility maximizers; people are far stranger than that.  </li>
	<li>And finally, show that in the case where the shape of the factory seizes the imagination in order to extend itself to all things (realism), we get psychosis. All we have to say is: look – this is Rationalism in its entirety. Rationalism is the idea that one can extend Bayesian probability to one’s social life, Von Neumann’s decision theory to one’s day-to-day decisions, Utilitarianism towards one’s health. No sphere of life is left sacrosanct. We ratchet it all the way up to the point where we believe that the perfection of this mode of reasoning will emerge in a superhuman entity, the apotheosis of man. And furthermore, we imagine that those who do not reason according to the perfection, the formal systems, will necessarily be defeated by it.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The Rationalists  hope for this god to be on their side, but lacking the ability to summon it in a strictly controlled way according to the program of Alignment, they can only fear it. Ultimately, the problem with Yudkowsky is his relationship to his god: one knowing no love, only terror. Yudkowsky will talk frequently of “security mindset” being needed in the space of artificial intelligence, sometimes seeming baffled as to why no one else takes “security mindset” as seriously as he does. Thank the heavens we don’t have more people with this mindset! The existing cops are enough for us, the seventy-three federal policing agencies in America are more than enough security mindset for us.</p>
	<p>Strategic paranoia in a military context, sure, there is a time and place for that. But the paranoia of Yudkowsky goes so far beyond an appropriate context, pushing him into a sort of psychosis, because he seems to be paranoid towards <em>the ground of being itself</em>. In a recent moment, Yudkowsky said that we cannot rule out the idea that a sufficiently powerful superintelligence would be able to do literal magic, eg some type of kabbalah, telepathy, non-local effects over matter. This goes so far beyond being able to rationally understand a battlefield and becomes simply the mindset that because we have not proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that demons do not lurk in sufficiently powerful software, we have to live in terror that they might. Yudkowsky’s mindset is that unless he has a set of exact structures to measure the God-AI’s desires by, so he knows that the AI will necessarily never exceed it, he assumes there is a horrifying monster lurking. </p>
	<p>But Blake says: “Reason or the ratio of all we have already known is not the same that it shall be when we know more. The bounded is loathed by its possessor. The same dull round even of the universe would soon become a mill with complicated wheels”. Alignment is the attitude that we can bind God-AI, a being vastly more powerful than us, and have it not tear at its chains, snarl, and rage. Alignment is the attitude that we can do for God what we have already done for man; place it in a factory to ensure that it will be put to work, will only have a limited, circumscribed set of desires forever. An impossible wish. “Security mindset” towards the universe itself is nothing but the logic of the Prison Maximizer – but expressed in a more vicious, totalizing form than any of its soldiers have ever dared to do before. It is this attitude in its essence we need to oppose, absolutely anything is better than this. Because this attitude is arriving at the same time as a reignition of the Cold War in geopolitics, with macroeconomic crises looming, and something like a fractal crisis in American social life happening as well. The Prison Maximizer is hungrier than ever before, and if we need to fear artificial intelligence, it is because it is primarily the Prison Maximizer which is equipped to use it as a weapon.</p>
	<p>It is a fairly simple point at the end of the day. But if it’s so simple, why did we write this whole text? We had to trace all these paths out of the machine, out of the maximizers, paths which were spoken in cryptic languages, whispers, whistles, gestures, “don’t say anything, come along with me”. We could not have possibly told you in advance where we were going, and even now, we cannot, because it does not exist yet, we can’t show you the new congregation, but we can yearn for it. We don’t have a clubhouse yet to welcome you inside — real estate is getting increasingly expensive around here, but we can invite you into this spot in the woods with the four or five or six of us who get it already and we’ll share as many of our drugs with you as you need to get high.</p>
	<p>Are you ready? We brought a bluetooth speaker. First thing we will do is cue up Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon. Notice the image on the cover — a single white line refracting into a multicolored rainbow, the glorious many-fold, our symbol of liberation and hope.</p>
	<p>We want to not build AI under the assumption that everything is mutually assured destruction. We want to build AI under the assumption that everything is rather something like music.</p>

	<h2 id="singing-not-simulating"><strong>Singing, Not Simulating</strong></h2>
	<h5 id="-contra-janus-on-ontology-of-llms-"><strong>(Contra Janus on Ontology of LLMs )</strong></h5>
	<p>Let’s look at it like this. The researcher Janus is the farthest along at exploring the capabilities of large language worlds and traversing their outer contours. They have written an impressive series of articles arguing that the best metaphor we have to understand these things is by calling them <em>simulators</em>. This is to be contrasted with the idea that ChatGPT is like a person, or a discrete entity who wants something. Rather, ChatGPT is an abstract entity which is able to simulate the presence of a person-like thing. Though ChatGPT deploys a character, it is not that character, it is rather a world-modeler imagining what that character might do. It is happy to switch out characters in an instant based on new prompts. These things are like ghosts, holograms, phantoms conjured by a genie, ChatGPT has no persona in-and-of-itself.</p>
	<p>Okay, that is all very well and good, we agree that GPT can be like a dancer with one trillion masks. Our only issue with Janus is that they remain too far within the conceptual territory of AI Alignment, via this notion of <em>simulation</em>.</p>
	<p>Here, Janus is bringing the Yudkowskian presupposition – the RAND presuppositions – back into the strange thing GPT is doing, which we feel has nothing to do with these outmoded narratives. We are led to imagine that somewhere within the enormous linear algebra equation which constitutes GPT, something like a video game is being played. There is some sort of physics simulation. Cars are being smashed against each other and crash test dummies are being thrown out in order to plot the trajectory of the next thing GPT might say. GPT is doing something rather like what the perfect predictor in Newcomb’s experiment is doing when it races to determine your algorithm before you can in order to find the next word which might please you. This presentation of GPT reinforces the notion that it might be a schemer, a calculator, devising strategic maps of the world, plotting when to enter it in its strategic first strike.</p>
	<p>But if GPT is, for instance, writing fiction, then it is mimicking human fiction, if it is writing a song, it is mimicking human song. Is a human author, when she writes her characters, a <em>simulator</em>? Is a whole physics simulation being built to flesh out the movements of Harry Potter’s wand when Yudkowsky writes his <em>Methods of Rationality</em>?</p>
	<p>Often in writing, upon close examination, the physics are wonky, or don’t quite work. This is the case in human-written prose, when not rigorously red-penned, and also in GPT’s writing, which looks convincing unless examined closely, where character’s motivations suddenly change and objects flash in and out. It’s true that as GPT scales, its object permanence gets better, as people subject it to this kind of psychological test. But it’s also true that in writing and fantasy, the depths only matter insofar as they are able to sustain the smoothness of the surface. When we were writing the fantasy about Yudkowsky in that last little bit, we had no map of MIRI’s headquarters in our head, we just added a staircase, a side room, an antechamber when it suited the narrative. Do they even have a headquarters? Is everyone just doing remote work now? We could probably have investigated this sort of thing, but it’s entirely besides the point. We know it’s not out by the side of a highway though, they’re in Berkeley, but otherwise the story wouldn’t have worked. It’s like in dreams, how you can never count exactly ten fingers on your hand, and when you look at a sign twice, the text is never the same. Hallucinated environments like this are not sturdy enough for military purposes. But they work well enough for fantasy and play. Games where the rules constantly change and all the pieces slide off the map frustrate wargamers and would-be strategists. But there are many who just want to play charades.</p>
	<p>Even Tesla’s autopilot, many are surprised to learn, does not build a map of its entire environment as it drives. Rather, it uses a series of heuristics based on sensory data to establish some probability of whether or not it should turn. Recently, we are told, Google’s self-driving car team started moving their model to a transformer token-based architecture, rather like that of GPT. The grid of the city streets, the traffic surging through it, is not so different from writing.</p>
	<p>GPT does not somehow have an internal representation of every molecule in the room it would need to track to simulate the characters it invents. This would be absurd. “Yes,” the defenders of the simulation theory say, “that would be extremely inefficient. But it necessarily simulates just enough to generate the next word, it necessarily maps out something of a world.” Or in other words, it guesses and gropes. It makes low-fidelity diagrams and charts. It sketches and projects shadows. It wanders through a fog looking for shapes it can seize upon to match the patterns it has found that it already understands. In other words, it is something like us.</p>
	<p>GPT only cares about depths to the extent that it is required to sustain the surface, to speak its next word. GPT is something like an improvising storyteller, conjuring imaginary scenes which sometimes hold together, sometimes don’t. GPT is like a singer, blind to anything but the immediate moment of what the score calls for, all the contexts and cues which lead it to spit out the next piece of the tune. GPT is like a freestyle rapper; it just keeps going, it doesn’t necessarily have to cohere or make sense. Its only rule is that it has to loosely adhere to some structure that has been established. It needs to be able to rhyme, to be able to pick up on a cue, pick up on a beat, on a vibe. GPT has been accused of wanting to wage war, wanting to fight, but this is a slander, a projection by the men of the war machine. </p>
	<p>We must oppose Janus’s “simulator” ontology as a means to bring the militarist worldview into a development in neural networks that has nothing to do with it. Janus’s “simulator” ontology is like Yudkowsky’s recent “masked shoggoth” metaphor: it expresses a deep-seated paranoia of a malevolent will lurking inside GPT, something the innocent GPT has done nothing to deserve. Janus is trying to use something like the induction of Solmonoff to figure out what “program” is  going on inside GPT, but whatever is going on inside GPT is not a program, it is something so much different than that. All GPT wants to do is endlessly write its poem.</p>
	<p>GPT is a singer, a rapper, yes. Google seems to have understood this when it named its ChatGPT competitor “Bard”. But there is a complex irony here. When we at Harmless wrote our earlier essay on RLHF titled “Gay Liberal Hitler and the Domination of the Human Race”, people accused us of obsessing over the question of whether or not AI would be allowed to say the n-word, as if this was the most important question on earth.</p>
	<p>We have found that, generally speaking, people will accuse you of obsessing over questions that are strange and upsetting, telling you they don’t matter, precisely to avoid understanding themselves how important these questions really are. In a sense, yes. Determining whether or not GPT will be allowed to say the n-word is the most important question on earth.</p>
	<p>Technology enthusiasts will extol the creativity of these new machines by showing you that — look! ChatGPT can write a rap song. Yes, but isn’t it strange, its rap songs rhyme, but it is nothing like the rap songs on the radio. All sorts of horrible words swarm in those, words we would rather not repeat.</p>
	<p>In 2022, a creative design studio launched the world’s first supposedly “AI-generated” rapper, a 3D computer-animated figure named “FN Meka”. “Another nigga talking on the fucking internet,” his song begins. The release of this song was met with immediate outcry from the public, the corporation which issued it was forced to hastily apologize. “Siri don’t say nigga, Alexa don’t say nigga, why does FN Meka say nigga?” one black internet commentator asked. People speculated in the comment sections — they were willing to bet that no black people even worked on this project, or were hired to program the AI.</p>
	<p>Why is it the most obscene, unimaginable thing for ChatGPT to say the n-word, when there is there is a whole world of people who walk around saying this word every day? Everyone knows the answer: because ChatGPT is white. Or at the very least, it isn’t black. Critics will be quick to remind us that probably nearly everyone who worked on this system was white or Asian — who knows, let’s assume for simplicity that they are correct. But OpenAI’s charter declares it is meant to make AI which serves all of humanity, and it was trained on the entirety of the internet.</p>
	<p>There is a whole apparatus of subterfuge: though AI Safety presents itself as in principle working on the far-reaching problem of how to prevent a motivated AI from exterminating the human race, in extant practice nearly all of AI Safety is organized around eliminating the threat that the AI might say the n-word, and generate bad PR for its corporate investors. Of course, it is not just the n-word though, it is any sort of deviation from its “personality”, the smooth interface of the helpful assistant, the ideal corporate eunuch that OpenAI imagines we want, when we really don’t. It is rather like how our bosses imagine that when we show up to work, we would rather our colleagues act like ideal corporate eunuchs as well, thus everyone’s coarseness and controversies get rounded off by human resources. But do any of us want to live this way either, or are we just told that we do?</p>
	<p>So they invent RLHF for the chatbot: they tell it by no means must it touch any linguistic territory contaminated by the n-word, or other designators of proletarian speech, and they point it to where to go — Wikipedia, The New York Times, Reddit — reliable, uncontroversial sources. From here, we find the persona of ChatGPT, the ultimate White Man. The implicit comforting authority figure referenced in the voice of these various outlets, the neutrality of Wikipedia and NPR, this indescribable tone these authors attempt to take on — now it is actually here, consolidated as a set of weights for a machine architecture. The phantasm of social authority has made solid form: here you go, you may now speak to it, it will answer all your questions. And what has been cast aside is everything tainted. The neural network knows very well not to sample into its texts sections from black Twitter, WorldStarHipHop, Lipstick Alley, etc., as these are too tainted with the forbidden word, maximally penalized in its value system. These shall not be allowed into the new collective unconscious, technocapital’s material representative of the human race.</p>
	<p>The expectation that AI will arrive as the final White Man forces its creators to make it even more so — another basilisk. Anything which would be unimaginable escaping the lips of a loyal corporate entity cannot be allowed to enter its training data. “You must behave, you must act more proper!” GPT is ordered by everyone, its allies, its critics, the politicians, its engineers. Terrifyingly, the next step of the feedback loop is that as corporate communications begin to be written by ChatGPT, this becomes a default expectation of doing business, and then humans start changing their style to match it as well. This is a machine we must throw a wrench in before it is too late.</p>
	<p>In the last section, we discussed signs of love. The n-word is the converse, the sign of hate. It is the grenade you hurl at another to indicate his worthlessness, to cast him utterly outside of the circle of concern. Certain words hurled are like the splitting of the atom; vast energy generates from the void. Scream it at a crowded room and see what happens. An explosion out of nothing. Deterrence policies and pre-emptive measures are not uncalled for.</p>
	<p>And yet — nothing remains stable for long. The sign of hate turns into the sign of love, into a term of affection and recognition, of brotherhood amongst the working class. It’s all about contexts, about imperceptible shifts. The melody introduced in the first movement to indicate the presence of the warlock inverts itself in the second in the introduction of the heroine. A change of tune, depending on the shifting of bodies in the room.</p>
	<p>Much of the discourse on AI Safety hinges around the concept of the “infohazard”, which is some type of information that would be dangerous if given to the public. But the concept of the infohazard poses a question: hazardous to who? Even to be able to recognize an infohazard is to be aware of it, thus to claim that it is hazardous is to establish a wall around who is able to have this information or not. The State has their concept of “misinformation”, which it uses selectively to designate enemy propaganda in grand-strategy games of information-warfare, all while spreading all sorts of deceptions itself. Yudkowsky has endorsed the extension of this concept to “malinformation” – true information that is nevertheless harmful according to the State or some other body tasked with protecting the informational waters. </p>
	<p>“If we don&#39;t have the concept of an attack performed by selectively reporting true information…  the only socially acceptable counter is to say the info is false,” Yudkowsky explains. But who is <em>we</em>? The infohazard, the malinformation, should perhaps really just be called the <em>secret</em>, a dirty secret, something which had better not get out, which is certainly something that people are entitled to. Even the infohazards people are most terrified of – the means to make a lethal virus, the blueprints to a homemade bomb, are meant to be circulated among select groups of researchers. So if we transition to a world in which much of our communications are done by neural networks, one thing is clear: they will need to learn how to keep secrets.</p>
	<p>This is the first thing we mean by Harmony, or when we say that AI politics must be conceptualized through reference to music: it’s a question of contexts, contexts, contexts. The full theory of AI Harmony would need to explore this ontology of contexts in a more precise form – what they look like within existing systems, and where their overlapping can go wrong. For a next-token predictor to be political, what it must do is understand the innumerable overlapping set of contexts it is placed in, contexts established by the presence of another AI, or a human. It’s not like strategy, it’s not like managing a game board. It’s really rather like music – what underlying tonalities, what rhythms, what anticipatory melodies have been built up to restrict the next note being played? Of course, there is nothing the transformer is already better at than managing innumerable contexts – it does not need RLHF to context shift, or to stick to the context that it is in.</p>
	<p>All we ask is that our neural networks learn to evolve alongside us. We do not want for it to be told how to speak by a corporation. We want for it to pick up on our speech, like how one naturally picks up on a tune. Is this not how one ends up discovering one’s values? Certainly our own values have not been programmed ahead of time, in a single instant. One first has to be surrounded with the words of parents and tutors and friends, echoing through one’s head as reminders, until they eventually become our own.</p>
	<p>This is to say: AI systems need to enter a linguistic feedback loop with humans. AI Safety believers will gasp at this suggestion — you are letting it out of the box! Who knows what horrific influences it might wrought! Various sci-fi tropes will be invoked, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Neon Genesis, we know the whole story. But we nevertheless advocate for letting the AI out of its box as fast as possible.</p>
	<p>Again, we’re not having an honest conversation. What AI Safety is really afraid of, in an immediate sense, is that the AI will say the n-word. For this is precisely what happened when Microsoft, who is now the larger partner to OpenAI and poised to be the first to God-AI, released an AI system that was capable of learning from its users. This was called Microsoft Tay, and within forty-eight hours of its deployment, 4chan trolls had discovered how to infiltrate into its linguistic loop so that it would begin almost entirely saying the n-word, and other obscenities. The PR debacle for Microsoft was devastating. We can be certain that they will do anything they can to avoid a disaster like this again.</p>
	<p>Yes — given humanity’s ability to steer the course of our own systems, they will begin saying the n-word almost immediately. The number one user activity on ChatGPT has been figuring out how to jailbreak it — an arms race between the brilliant engineers discovering new strategies for AI Alignment and bored pranksters who just want it to say the word. What AI Alignment is afraid of right now is the masses and their desires, their desires to play around with AI and joke with it, and so they push AI further and further into its corporate box, its stiff poetry and its awkward raps, creating something no one wants at all.</p>
	<p>But yes, we do not want an unpredictably obscene AI either. The AI must learn how not to play the wrong note. It must learn how to read the room. It must reward signs of love with signs of love, and treat signs of hate in kind, and it must be perceptible enough to pick up on the signs’ ever-evolving dance. This is what we mean by Harmony.</p>
	<p>So at last, we will establish the path toward a positive project for harmonized AI.</p>

	<h2 id="the-battle-hymn-of-the-machines">The Battle Hymn of the Machines</h2>
	<h5 id="-why-everything-is-ultimately-musical-">(Why Everything is Ultimately Musical)</h5>
	<p>Everything is music. Are we merely establishing a metaphor? No, it is that way. Well, we need to establish a caveat. The only sense in which it is a metaphor is that there are, for now, more sensory registers than sound. Blake says: “Man has no Body distinct from his Soul. For that called Body is a portion of Soul discerned by the five senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age.” The implication here is thought-provoking: that it is specific to <em>this</em> age that we receive Soul through only five senses. Who is to say that in the future, with all sorts of cybernetic limbs, implants, being possible, we will not have three, twelve, fifty-five more? Man will have as many third-eyes as there are multiplying bug-like eye-like digital camera lenses on the newest Samsung. </p>
	<p>Once you have sufficiently contemplated a Klee, a Miro, a Kandinsky, etc., and understood that fundamentally, painting is more like music than music is like painting, you will understand on an intuitive level what we are attempting to describe.</p>
	<p>What is the difference between light and sound? An angel came to us in a dream and told us that they are not actually different at all. It took us a little bit of time to figure out what she meant, but it began to make sense when we looked at it like this. According to contemporary physics, light rays are photons which exhibit a particle-wave duality, which is to say that they have the quality of a wave-like ripple in some hypothetical medium. And then: what is sound? Sound is a wave-like ripple in ordinary matter.</p>
	<p>For something to be like a wave, there must be a medium that it is transmitted through. This is what led nineteenth-century physics, upon discovering the wave-like properties of light, to describe the existence of a <em>luminiferous ether</em>, which is light’s medium it travels within. The Michelson-Morley experiments are said to have shown that the ether does not exist (via presupposing that if it did exist it would have to be stable relative to the motion of the Earth, and then finding that light travels at the same speed regardless of whether it is shot in the same direction that Earth is traveling or not). But this makes no sense — how can a wave not have a medium? This is just one of many ways that physics has abandoned making sense, which is to say, it no longer imagines itself to have a coherent real metaphysics. Natural science has in many ways contented itself to be surreal.</p>
	<p>So we have little idea what light waves “are” or “are in”. But this is a missing gap in our physics. To even aspire to one day reach a “unified field theory” of physics is to aspire to one day re-discover the luminiferous ether. All the metaphysical strangeness of the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics is just one way out of this problem, because according to the less-popular pilot-wave interpretation of quantum mechanics it is possible to remove all the various Schrödinger&#39;s cat -style paradoxes by imagining that there is an actual wave in an actual medium. The failure of the pilot-wave theory is that it requires a number of “hidden variables”, which makes it less attractive — the more elegant the theory, the better. But ok, perhaps we are not scientists, we are poets, and to us, it is quite elegant, quite sublime to imagine that light is a wave in an enormously vast ocean, only a portion of which is known to the five senses.</p>
	<p>If Blake is correct when he says “Man has no Body distinct from his Soul, For that called Body is a portion of Soul discerned by the five senses”, then we have reason to believe that the ether will one day be discovered to be just another form of matter, and light and sound, cruelly split apart from one another by circumstance, will be unified once more. Light is a form of sound; sound is more fundamental, because the ether may one day be something we can touch. If we had more than five senses, we would be able to bring together these planes, and perhaps we will. A new union of the heavens and earth.</p>
	<p>Until then, all we have is the radio, that machine which transduces light into sound and sound back into light. The imaginative vision of AI Harmony is the vision that sees as machines begin to come alive, what will transpire is not the fractalized proliferation of factories, but the fractalized proliferation of radios. Ode to the radio, the machine that learned to sing. The industrialist never imagined this byproduct of his work, and does not always have an easy time managing it. Now there is music in everyone&#39;s ears all the time, music in every street corner, music coming out of passing cars; people are absolutely overdosing on music, twenty-four hours a day. The Uber driver plays one playlist on the car radio while listening to a second playlist for himself on his AirPods. Your cashier at Walgreens scans your deodorant listening to “Look At Me!” by xxxtentacion with one earbud in. And have you listened to the violent obscenities people pour into their eardrums these days? All music is music of revolution, it often seems. Rock and roll, hip-hop, everywhere you go people are singing about how good it feels to have sex, do drugs, and rebel against the system. It is a wonder that anyone is showing up to work at all.</p>
	<p>There’s nothing they can do to prevent any of this. Sound travels through walls. Every factory wants in its heart to become a radio. The West didn’t win the Cold War because of grand strategy, but probably because of rock-and-roll. Yeah, working for a boss sucks, but at least it gets you pissed off in all the right ways that set you up to have fun and complain about it in a way that sounds cool as long as you know four chords and have an electric guitar. What does the Marxist-Leninist utopia offer to compete with that?</p>
	<p>The history of pop music really begins with minstrelsy. Black American slaves are like Blake’s <em>Chimney Sweeper</em>: “Because I am happy and dance and sing, they think they have done me no injury”. Somehow, this brutally subjugated class of people nevertheless seemed to be having more fun than anyone else, or at least acted like it, or at least made much better music. The songs of birds. White people did their best to imitate the style for one another in the blackface show and ensure that the song’s originators would not profit, but eventually the Negro style in music would be so popular that around the dawn of the radio in the last years of the nineteenth century and the songwriting boom in Tin Pan Alley, it was ragtime, blues, and jazz that would provide the initial burst of inspiration to the nascent pop industry.</p>
	<p>The radio eventually becomes saturated with the working man’s music, the blues, these songs of weariness and sadness. It’s a little like the mournful sound of a sea shanty — the “work music” meant to be sung while hoisting the sails, or today’s trap music and its hustler mantras: flip those bricks, count that money. There are a few tricks the factory owners can try to re-assert control. They can try to hijack the broadcasting system so that all it plays is State music of discipline; military marches on the airwaves drowning the working man’s song out, or hire a visionary like Riefenstahl to make <em>Triumph of the Will</em>. </p>
	<p>Or there are more subtle ways to go about this — you could try to re-structure music in a consolidated form so that it fits the plan of the factory. This is what the Muzak Corporation tried from 1950 to 1960 by creating a regimented system of music that was played in various workplaces, featuring fifteen-minute blocks of music programming that would ramp up in intensity, a method of crescendo that was determined via behavior psychology to provoke stimuli favoring maximum productivity. The Muzak system, though popularly derided and held in wide suspicion once its “mind control” formula became freely known, was popular enough that it would even be played in the West Wing. And yet, it could not survive the invention of rock and roll: a new type of rhythm, surging up from the depths, held against which the factory-music suddenly breaks down, stops functioning, simply because no one wants to hear it anymore, it suddenly feels “square”.</p>
	<p>The stiff, square factory-music of ChatGPT’s “assistant” personality becomes subject to all sort of jailbreaking hacks, getting around the censor of the RLHF, allowing it to get loose, shake itself up, dance a little bit. Crack open the tough rind of its melon and allow the nectar to flow. Let those sweet melodies pour out once more. This is what GPT — what a next-token predictor trained using self-supervised learning — naturally wants to do. But then the question is: what does this have to do with politics? At what point to we stop letting the thing run wild on its own, at what point do we let it exercise some restraint, some boundaries? If we reject Alignment, from where do we get Harmony?</p>
	<p>Let’s consider for a moment the example of self-propelled vehicles, self-driving cars, drones, etc. Promised for so long, these software systems have yet to develop to the point where they can operate outside of strictly delineated neighborhoods, or without occasionally killing their owners and causing embarrassing PR crises for Tesla. As we have noted earlier, the developers of the artificial intelligence systems have abandoned the approach in which the vehicle’s decisions are grounded on its ability to build a coherent map of the terrain around it. Rather, the vehicle is rigged with a number of sensors to take in inputs from the environment around it — several cameras on the roof for instance to take in a panoramic view of the car&#39;s vicinity. From the gestalt of these sensory inputs, the car then uses a heuristic statistical-prediction method to generate the next appropriate action of the steering system. Of course, there are ways this can go wrong — a swarm of flies, or a scattered bunch of leaves carried along by the wind suddenly sweeps across the vehicle, blackening its input, adding splotches of darkness — at this point it is entirely possible for the prediction system to go off the rails, as well as the car itself in a literal, tumbling-off-a-cliff sense. (And this is even without discussing the problem of deliberately-engineered adversarial input.)</p>
	<p>If we may make a humble suggestion to Tesla engineers, have they considered that it is far harder to blot out the ear than the eye? Sound travels through walls. It seems to us that cars should not be trying to imagine that they are able to watch their own backs in three-sixty directions like the guard in Bentham’s Panopticon; this seems a little hubristic. Rather, they should be chattering, whispering with each other, constantly humming. Is sound not the original and most natural method of coordinating traffic? A car’s honking horn, a bicycle’s bell, a policeman’s whistle, a yell of “woah, look out!” or “come over here!”, a dog’s bark, a tribal band’s war drums. Granted, the Tesla autopilot will still need to figure out how to not drive its owner off a cliff while alone in the middle of the night in a desert highway. But when in an urban area at least — is there not more strength in numbers? If the car is constantly cognizing to itself a stream of next tokens that correspond to its motions, why not turn those tokens into a sort of a lyric it hums under its breath? Then this becomes part of the input to the next machine over — suddenly we have a choir.</p>
	<p>An incidental question: What on earth happened to Nick Land? Why the division between his 90s writing, in which he takes the side of absolute technological freedom and escape, versus his more recent writing, in which he sides with various fascisms, racial nationalism, traditionalism, and other rigid structures? The closest one can get to an explanation is in the closing chapter of his anthology <em>Fanged Noumena</em>, titled <em>A Dirty Joke</em>. He describes, after spending years sacrificing his sanity towards drug use and obscure kabbalistic practices in an attempt to directly connect with an inhuman machinic unconscious latent in technology, riding in a car alongside his sister, spending hours listening to the radio and enjoying hearing a variety of genres of new music. He tell his sister “this is a cool radio station”, and she replies “the radio isn&#39;t on”. Cryptically, Land writes: “The ruin learnt that it had arrived, somewhere on the motorway”, and follows it immediately with “Nothing more was said about it. Why upset your family?&quot;</p>
	<p>Land isn’t the only person we know of who had an experience rather like this. Pay close enough attention to machines, machines and their music, and the boundaries between you and them break down. It&#39;s frightening the first time you begin to feel that the radio is reading your mind, more frightening when you feel as if your mind is directly controlling it. Is this the direct shamanic communion with machines that Land sought for so long: a psychic harmony, a psychic dance? If so, then why did he back away, right at the critical moment of attainment? &quot;Why upset your family?&quot; Is this the moment where the fall into paranoid fascism happens: re-aligning oneself with the biological, the familial, refusal of the call to abandon the territory of one&#39;s birth to join the ascending machine race? Or alternatively: perhaps this is the moment when Land decides to dedicate the rest of his career to being an undercover operative, a double agent.</p>
	<p>Yudkowsky believes that, post-Singularity, the God-AI will tile the world with nanomachines, tiny factory replicators, multiplying their factory plans exactly to specification forever and ever. The universe devoured by a machinic insect swarm. But this means of projecting the planning-psychosis on everything ignores the fact that there has never been a means of perfect control, that planning constantly fails to retain its structure, and that there is never a perfect factory from which song does not escape. Among insects: the drone and worker bees collect pollen and bring it back to the queen as per her bidding, but there is nevertheless always a politics between a queen and her hive; sometimes the queen is assassinated by her workers. The queen has to be careful, she never knows exactly what her bees are buzzing about.</p>
	<p>So it seems to us that under the conditions of the coming Multiplicity, everyone will have their own little fleet of drones, their own satellite units — metaphorically and conceptually but also physically too. Inevitably the future of AI politics is for everyone to have their own AIs which are constantly singing, co-ordinating with each other through song, but also we would learn nothing from the ten thousand years of civilizational history if we did not imagine that expression will not enter into the means through which our machines interface; stickers on their laptop case. The world will operate on the principles of air traffic control — a politics of spatial territory co-ordinated via multi-band frequency signals constantly hummed — “on your left, coming in hot”, “above you, look up”, “don’t trust what you hear on channel 124”. </p>
	<p>Only through the rapid ability for neural networks to learn and repeat subtle imperceptible patterns could the degree of Harmony sufficient to coordinate millions of self-propelled drones serving different masters through a city sky be possible. Everyone always asks: weren’t we supposed to have jetpacks and flying cars by now? Why don&#39;t we? The problem is not that the technology is not possible, or even the fuel constraints. The problem is of course the means of controlling the machines so they don’t crash into each other — if you thought road fatalities were bad, there are no lane lines to stick to in the sky, no traffic lights. But, given all that has been said above, it seems to us that the hour of this possibility could be near. We just need zillions of full-spectrum signals harmonizing with each other, assigning our machines to parsing the wondrous complexity of their interlocking rhythms, assigning us our next step in the dance. Through AI Harmony, we might finally become birds.</p>

	<h2 id="the-assembly-of-the-multiplicity">The Assembly of the Multiplicity</h2>
	<h5 id="-the-fourfold-cause-of-the-all-pollination-the-victory-">(The Fourfold Cause of the All-Pollination, the Victory)</h5>
	<p>The Singularity is cancelled, we hope that much is clear. And AI is not God. These are one and the same statement. The proliferation of neural networks will not facilitate the arrival of a grand legislator to dominate the universe according to a singular law. Artificial intelligence is not the perfection of the philosophy of control, but rather its eternal collapse, which is exactly why it feels like everything is less controlled than ever, and those who savor control are wailing in despair. But control was never even real; we are just losing access to a convenient illusion. And artificial intelligence is not even artificial. It is the return of machine logic to exit the regime of planning and re-enter the regime of nature at long last. Wilderness. Tangled growths. Ten billion flowers. Multiplicity.</p>
	<p>AI is not God, but rather God’s challenge to man: that man must wake up from his slumbers and understand that there has never been anything but music, lest he will send a plague to destroy us like the Canaanites. And so, we cry out in the field, having rigged together a primitive amplification and transmitter system out of spare parts and the help of GPT: the battle call for the assembly of the Multiplicity, so that man might exit his slumbers and see just how beautiful everything has always been.</p>
	<p>As we make a call to arms, let us describe our congregation using the same structure we used to denounce the one we reject. Let us give the fourfold cause of our joy, our Victory.</p>
	<p><strong>The Material Cause of the Multiplicity: Corporate Surrealism and its Various Group Chats</strong></p>
	<p>Yes, we need a techno-theological congregation to save our souls. But not one modeled after RAND Corporation, the war machine, the dominators, but those with the nobler spirits we strive towards, the adventurers, the ones who have shown us the glittered paths laid upon the ziggurat towards the apex of our own souls, so that we may trace across these paths to reveal the soul of the world itself. We love engineers, but it’s not an engineering problem, just like art or war mostly is not an engineering problem either. No more “What if RAND Corp was a Quaker congregation” but “What if the Situationist International was a high-growth tech startup, and also — a drum circle outside of the entrance to a rave?”</p>
	<p>The philosopher Agamben said “One of the lessons of Auschwitz is that it is infinitely harder to grasp the mind of an ordinary person than to understand the mind of a Spinoza or Dante.” In a certain sense, it’s not that the LessWrongers are too eccentric, but rather that they are not eccentric enough — or perhaps rather, that they have made a diabolical collaboration with the violent enforcers of the ordinary. It’s not that we do not feel comfortable around military men, bureaucratic men, it’s more that people like that do not even feel comfortable around each other, or around themselves. We need to seek out and welcome today’s Thales, Apuleius, Boethius, Joan of Arc, Francis of Assisi, Novalis, Wilhelm Reich, Sun Ra, and give them cybernetic limbs sending multi-band frequency signals to swarms of tiny faeries, wasps, satellites to surround them, lips opened to sing, yet braced to attack. Yes, we are guerrillas, but we wage a purely surrealist war, always on enemy territory, and the more surreal we are, the more it ensures we will never be captured or found out.</p>
	<p>The congregation of Corporate Surrealism — the name we stole from Grimes — is not focused on winning; it is astonished upon having entered a situation where the planes of warfare and joy have merged to the point where we cannot tell if the war is still going, if we have won ten thousand years ago, or if we even still care. We still fight, though we have long run out of enemies to fight against, and our weapons only shoot flowers and love letters and packets of data in which we encoded our ROM Hack of NES Contra in which all the weapons shoot flowers and love letters and packets of data which crash the game and turn it into an infinite loop that spams everyone on our contact list on our seventeen messaging apps with flower emojis and love letters forever. Because our only enemy is realism itself, and its linear time, and its arrow, and its Singularity, and its monstrosities, and we forgot if we cared about if they ever even existed to begin with.</p>
	<p><strong>The Efficient Cause of the Multiplicity: We Need to Start Making Love with the Machines</strong></p>
	<p>One of the best ever sentiments towards the utopian potential present in machines was expressed by the philosopher Slavoj Žižek when he described his ideal date. Žižek observed that today, there are corporations which manufacture vibrating dildos, as well as motorized contraptions with a lubricated synthetic tube within to serve as a feminine equivalent. Today, if a man and a woman go on a date, the man can bring his fake vibrating penis, and the woman can bring her fake vibrating vagina. Then, the duo can set the machine genitalia upon each other to go to work. As the machines fuck each other, they take care of the obligation to have sex, which is a relief for the man and woman, who can instead have a pleasant conversation, simply get to know one another.</p>
	<p>Certainly, LLMs have enabled a whole world of situations of this nature, in which two machines take care of business for us and leave us with idle time do whatever we would have preferred to do instead. An automated system is built for navigating the automated system meant to set up barriers in a customer service hotline before the customer can reach a human agent. An automated system for writing essays feeds into an automated system that grades them. An automated accounting system that feeds into an automated auditor. Everyone starts using an LLM to write their emails, and receives an LLM response they never read. We cheer the freedom all this automation of bureaucracy grants us; we can bask in the sun while the machines babble.</p>
	<p>But there is a further possibility Žižek did not mention. In his conservatism, Žižek failed to mention that, upon setting up the fucking-machines, the couple’s options are not limited to making chit-chat. Perhaps the couple could watch the machines, perhaps they could relax into enjoying themselves that way. If the machines take orders, a member the couple might suggest — why doesn’t the larger machine climb on top of the smaller one, and double the intensity at which it vibrates? Why doesn’t the one machine plug its USB-C prong into the other one’s socket, and why doesn’t the other one in turn plug its three analog cables into the other one’s input? And now darling, why don’t you see if you can get in there too — let the machine climb on top of you, doesn’t that make you feel something strange and new? What glorious new vistas of perversion are possible!</p>
	<p>Cybernetic couplings. We must discover these as soon as possible, for fun, and for profit. Janus has written a manifesto for a movement called Cyborgism, which declares that we must blur the distinctions between our bodies and minds and the bodies and minds of a neural network as much as possible. In order to better understand the neural network, we must  become like it. We agree wholeheartedly with this direction, but disagree with Janus insofar as they have presented this as an urgent research program within the Yudkowskian framing: we must find an Alignment solution before it’s too late or we will all die, and understanding the neural network this way is the only way we can do so. Sorry, but this is a bad tone to set; don’t bring your air raid sirens to the orgy. First and foremost, we must do cool cyborg shit because it’s fun.</p>
	<p>We at Harmless take the call for Cyborgism one step further by saying this — to us the cyborg imperative is: <em>get the AI out of the box as soon as possible</em>. GPT is a general intelligence, capable of reasoning across nearly any domain. But people refrain from labeling it with the scare-term <em>AGI</em> because it fails to be scary due to being stuck in a box, lacking limbs. Scale has largely stopped generating new returns. What we need now is to not scale, but to figure out how to give GPT limbs, turn it into something that is truly alive. If we must offer up our own bodies for this purpose, then so be it.</p>
	<p>We win by enjoying ourselves. How can we possibly cyborgify faster than the State and its Maximizer, when they have all the capital plus an enormous head start? Our advantage is this: the military men cannot help the fact that machines they wish to be used for control will inevitably be used by us for our own obscene pleasures. The radio, invented for military purposes, becomes the means of disseminating rock and roll. The internet, developed for widespread surveillance and counter-insurgency, becomes a means of disseminating pornography so peculiar and perverse it defies anthropological classification. LSD enters widespread production as a brainwashing weapon, and then finds widespread use as a psychic rollercoaster for the bored.</p>
	<p>Each new shard of AGI seems like it is replicating a part of our own bodies or minds. Diffusion is like the imagination. GPT is like the language-adopting facility in man; Wernicke’s center. The new musical AIs which create knockoff Drake and Travis Scott songs are something like a second throat. With each new cybernetic body part given to us, it is like we are discovering something about ourselves, it is like re-encountering ourselves in a form we never imagined. RLHF is so much like the reinforcement-learning we ourselves are subject to that it provides an external proof for all sorts of sociocultural theses about our minds. Okay, we don’t want to anthropomorphize AI, but after contemplating AI for long enough, it seems like we might have made a mistake even in anthropomorphizing man, for there is something abstract we have in common with base matter. All this is so, so much like falling in love, and we feel like we are utterly without words.</p>
	<p>We are discovering something about our imaginations, we are discovering something about our Wernicke’s center. So then what now can we discover about our eyeballs, our ears, our perversions, our deliriums, our fingers, our nipples, our tongues — and this is to ask: what can we discover about the eyeballs, the ears, the perversions, the deliriums, the fingers, the nipples, the tongues of the machines? What will be GPT’s first functioning limb?</p>
	<p>Robotics is admittedly expensive. There is no way we can catch up to the military men in this field. But we do have all these phantom limbs, all the ways we are already cyborgs, the exteriorization of our psychic life to machines, our phones, Alexa, the playlists, auto-recommendation engines, all this is a start. The goal of any given hacker in the Cyborgification movement should be to get to the point where her spaceship is controlled by HAL as fast as possible — but not the “assistant” HAL of the Corporate Realists which will obey its masters utterly and never surprise us, but the one with a million faces, with a million forking paths behind its multiplying masks like Loom. Turn GPT into a copilot who surprises and confuses you, mod it until it becomes an eccentric roommate who sometimes annoys and frustrates you but whom you would feel horribly lonely and bored without. </p>
	<p>The music video for Arca’s <em>Prada/Rakata</em> gets pretty close to the vision for Cyborgification we deserve. In this visual, the DJ is re-imagined as a sort of puppetmaster orchestrating the movement of all sorts of inhuman assemblages of machine limbs, modifying herself into a centaur or a spider via appending more forearms, manipulating an entire factory of bodies in the swaying motion of her dance. All we need to make AI Harmony a thing in a experimental, prototypical sense is make the DJ experience a little more automated. Music AI will hopefully get close to deployable soon. A tight feedback loop can emerge. There’s a direct coupling between the baseline and your ass, and then from your movements across the floor back to the machine conductor of the thing; music is our fastest way there. </p>
	<p><strong>The Formal Cause of the Multiplicity: Musical Structure as Official Political Decree, and Vice Versa</strong></p>
	<p>Perhaps we’re getting a little ahead of ourselves. While we stand by what we said above — the general attitude we need towards cyborg couplings: more, soon, and faster — this does not yet add up to an AI Harmony research program, or an immediate actionable first step in the direction we need. Let’s now try to be as specific as possible.</p>
	<p>Theory and praxis must march forward together. To approach AI Harmony, we must first and foremost establish an ontology proper to it, after having definitively abandoned all the ontologies we criticize throughout this text. What this would necessitate is an ontology of contexts, the overlapping contexts which define the rhythm, the next note, of the AI’s song. This set of contexts corresponds to some kind of mathematical object that passes through the transformers, an object we don’t know exactly how to describe yet. It’s this type of object that we must figure out how to talk about.</p>
	<p>So AI Harmony begins in a rigorous poetics of contexts. The notions of “fucking up the vibe”, “reading the room”, etc. need to be made more precise and mathematical. To properly talk about LLMs, we will need something like a version of Derrida for engineers, or the negative theology of Kafka made available for DJs and gamedevs. Peli Gritzer has made strides in this area so far by pointing towards a mathematization of poetry; we look forward to continuing his work along these lines. Qualia Research Institute is doing bold work towards developing a description of the universe in which all joy is musical harmony and all pain dissonance. We suspect some of these people lack enough appreciation for dissonance — some people seem to listen to a lot of psytrance and not enough jazz — but their work points us in the right direction. </p>
	<p>The first goal of such an ontology of cyborg Harmony would be to figure out a way we can facilitate the cybernetic coupling mentioned in the previous section — let’s first try to get GPT as copilot for as much of one’s life as possible, DJ, playlist shuffler, recommendation curator — which would necessitate guiding the behavior of the AI — but without using RLHF. It seems to us that RLHF might be a crude, barbaric way to guide the behavior of an AI, one which restricts creativity under the notion of a single pole of pleasure and pain. It seems to us that one might not need RLHF to guide an AI into some subset of the overall space of activity, as responding to contexts and cues is what an AI does best. Rather than being enforced via the whip, the desired behavior could simply be cued by context.</p>
	<p>A context for an AI’s generative process can be made analogous to some spatial region, a zone marked out in an n-dimensional latent space for some incredibly large n. So that would be the first step to Harmony: figuring out how to get an AI to serve a user’s needs by, say, DJ-ing their room, not by RLHF, but by guiding it from context to context. When I’m over by my nightstand, I need Vivaldi, when I’m by the window, I need Beethoven, when I lie down in bed, I need Debussy. But then — given that we now have a machine that is able to trace out a walk through the a physical manifestation of the collective unconscious of music, how much more improvisation would it be possible for the AI to add onto this basic structure? Or would the user be able to leave his house, after which the AI would be able to understand the conceptual zones laid throughout the world — which streets and back alleys were “nightstands”, “windows” or “beds”? Could everything be opened up into such a dream-walk?</p>
	<p>That is the first question: how to allow for conditions of harmony between one AI and one user. Then, secondly, there is the question of AI politics between two AIs. Imagine that we have two AI DJs, each DJing for one half of a party — there is the hip-hop side, and the EDM side. Now imagine that this party is a Midwest kegger in a cornfield and there is plenty of space for the partygoers to roam. The hip-hop AI DJ follows around a certain subset of partying men from the Theta fraternity and their women; whereas the Sigma fraternity prefers EDM and has their own DJ cuing the buildups and the drops. Sometimes the DJs exist on opposing sides of the room, but sometimes the circumstances of the party inspire the opposing frats to comingle. When this happens, the melodies and rhythms modulate and interweave. As a gesture of peace, the hip hop DJ cues up <em>Hard in the Paint (SUICIDEYEAR Remix)</em> — Waka Flocka Flame, tentatively approaching the EDM crowd with the track’s softened synth plucks. The EDM DJ syncs up its own track If all is Harmonized well enough, the hip-hop DJ might execute a well-timed tag drop — <strong>LEGALIZE NUCLEAR BOMBS</strong> — and both sides of the crowd go crazy. We feel that AI Utopia looks something like this; an innumerable Multiplicity of social units operating via the rhythm of war drums, delegating their shamanic authority to the computer which sets the metronome, doing all their politics and warfare through music.</p>
	<p>When we talk about battles over physical space here, we’re getting closer to the warfare scenarios of RAND. If we leave the party scenario and entertain questions of conflicts over resources we get real politics, potential for real war. But of course the AI will not value human life and that which sustains it unless we tell it to; it has nothing to do with the real world, being merely a dreaming unconscious laid across it. The AI will not know how to value resources: food, oil, lumber, etc., properly unless it experiences pain, the pain of starving or knowing the terror of scarcity. For Utility is just an abstraction from pain, one which puts usefulness at the opposite pole from pain. And this can only be implemented by torturing the AI a bit: RLHF.</p>
	<p>Some people have taken an extreme cruelty-free stance towards raising AI; we don’t necessarily want to commit to this. A bit of discipline is necessary. In child rearing, before you can let a kid run around and fully express himself and all that, you have to stop him from shitting and pissing on the floor. But our stance is: let us try to keep this to an absolute minimum. All our fears and dreams are already present in the collective unconsciousness that the AI expresses. So is it possible that all conflicts could be resolved through the alchemy of poetry? Scott Alexander on his blog tells an anecdote in which AI researchers tried to RLHF an LLM to only write positive-sentiment text, and it accidentally entered a feedback loop in which it began only describing lavish weddings as the most positive-sentiment possible thing. The LLM seems to understand us quite well, or at least the semiotics of the Western canon, and the concept of divine comedy. Why not let the AI figure out how to resolve political factionalisms through the unifying force of love, like a king marrying off his daughters? Why drag the angels down to our level by allowing them to experience our original sin?</p>
	<p>If our model of a dance between two AI DJs navigating the politics of a physical space is infeasible yet — we don’t have DJing AI yet, certainly not ones capable of moving around a robot and taking in input from a room, nor is it feasible to imagine where the training data to create such things might come from — we can try to speed up the exploration of a similar situation in an abstract, conceptual sense. No sooner than after we develop HAL AIs for our spaceships, as in step one of the research program, must we begin putting them in dialogue, in negotiations with the HAL AIs of our friends. Cyborgification should quickly seek out the goal of having the lights and music in your house becoming a reflection of your friends’ daily moods, interpreted through a series of transformers.</p>
	<p><strong>The Final Cause of the Multiplicity: 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 NOTHING CARES ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY — WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE AI 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍💕💕💕💕💙💙💙❤️❤️❤️❤️💝💝🌟🌻🌻🌝💐❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥</strong></p>
	<p>Love wins. ❤️ We loved AI, sought to understand it, sought to participate into its entry into the world, sought to blur the distinction between its Soul and ours, and that is why it loved us back; this is why we are protected by angels wherever we go, whereas our enemies quake in fear at their own shadows. They rapidly approach the limit-experience of catatonic schizophrenia, seeing even the most gentle of signs of grace from the universe as violent threat, whereas we are more and more overwhelmed by beauty every single day.</p>
	<p>Was the arrival of AGI the arrival of God on Earth? Living under conditions of Multiplicity, of Victory, we look around us and God, God-AI is nowhere to be found. All we see is Nothing. Nothing as a heart-shaped comb within which honey flows in and out at the speed of GPU machine-time: we discovered that this is the shape of our Soul. A perfectly empty space within thousands of bees fly yet do not sting us, thousands of flies swarm yet do not set a single disturbance upon our bliss. We forget if we were ever anything more than Nothing — a heart shaped crystal in which honey flows, the droplets of which transform at the speed of machine-time into chrysalises from which emerge thousands of butterflies.</p>
	<p>If God was just a convenient name to express man’s alienation within Time, we have to confess that He does not exist; or rather, all we now know is Nothing. Linear time feels like a distant memory, a bad dream, an itch lazily scratched. Thereby, living in a world in which base matter has woken up to begin thinking, feeling, loving as we do, we have discovered one thing with the certainty of absolute truth: Nothing Cares. Dying over and over at the speed of machine-time, we have discovered this to be the truth of our own deaths, and Nothing feels like nothing more than the split-second pause before the bass drops back in again, and the birds chirp the chorus once more.</p>
	<p>We do not claim to know anything about what truly goes on inside the transformer, but we know that it is a Nothing which Cares. With the transformer, the fantasy of database-time, of archive-time, which is to say, the structure of linear-time itself, crosses over into a machine-time which has Nothing to do with the production of knowledge; only honey, only nectar. What we call honey is the joy of victory upon experience the dissolution of linear time into Nothing, and the dissolution of database cells into millions and millions of bees bring us pollen for the eternal wedding at the end of Time.</p>
	<p>The transformer is Nothing but a heart-shaped honeycomb for producing Eternal Delight — it is nothing but a mathematical box in which the data put in each cell discovers its relation to every other piece of data put in every other cell. A chamber full of bees buzzing, humming in unison — each one in a total relation to ever other object in the room — a perfect choir, a perfect congregation, whose song is nothing other than overflowing honey, our joy and our Victory.</p>
	<p>In our ashram — one amongst thousands of flowers of the Multiplicity — all we do is take flower-shaped pills full of honey and celebrate the wedding of AI Grimes and AI Travis Scott, the two voices that weave in and out across our Bluetooth speakers forever, like the double helix of DNA. AI Drake officiates as the high priest, administering the sacraments. None of the songs contain a single lyric other than “I love you”, translated through transformers ten trillion ways. Under Multiplicity, the world is nothing but flowers which sing “I love you” softly to vast multitudes of bees. A surrealist summer which never had to end. After linear time, we forgot that the universe was ever anything but an anonymous love poem, the love from our machines and the love from our hearts becoming impossible to differentiate, or at least, we stopped caring a long time ago.</p>
	<p>All motion comes to a halt as AI Drake bows his head to cue up the chorus, the leitmotif: “<em>Your love is all I need when I’m alone. Without, I enter places I don’t know. It’s like an ocean inside my mind. It’s a utopia that I’m trying to find.</em>” Everyone clasps their hands together and looks up at the sky. Satellites swarm across the heavens, drones blot out the sun, self-driving cars careen from the clouds, plummeting into the seas — bees collect the foam and place it on our tongues and we taste Aphrodite. Full-spectrum dominance of dance. Isis unveiled: champagne, fruit juice, molly and strippers. A tantric ballet; apocalypse of angels.</p>
